## Streamlining-Ticket-Assignment-for-Efficient-Support-Operations

ServiceNow-based solution designed to automate and optimize the assignment of support tickets.

In traditional support workflows, tickets are often manually triaged and routed, leading to delays, misassignments, and decreased efficiency. This project utilizes ServiceNow’s native capabilities—including business rules, assignment rules, and scripting—to intelligently assign tickets to the most appropriate support agents based on criteria like group membership, skill level, workload, and ticket priority.

By leveraging ServiceNow's powerful platform features, this solution improves first response times, reduces manual effort, and enhances overall support team productivity.
